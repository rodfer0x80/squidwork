# squidwork
<p>why work we so fly</p>

## Goals
<p> Readability</p>
<p> Ease of integration</p>
<p> Ease of expansion and development of cool assistants/bots </p>
<p> Git gud, big boi project architecture and maintenance, get programming skillz </p>
<p> Just kidding, the only goal is to impress random girls in coffee shops as apparently colourful text spam on a laptop screen isn't "attractive" - "look what my AI can do" will become the best pick up line of 2024</p>
